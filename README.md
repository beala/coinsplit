## Introduction

This is a set of utility scripts designed to help you back up your bitcoin wallet. They are designed to be used with an Ubuntu Live CD.

`bitcoin-setup.sh` installs all the prereqs for `splitsec.sh`.

`splitsec.sh` takes a bitcoin wallet (or any file), encrypts it with an autogenerated key, and then splits the key into shares. These shares can later be used to reconstruct the key.

## Instructions

1. Load Ubuntu (tested on 12.10) onto a Live CD.
2. Boot the Live CD and connect to the Internet.
3. Run the setup script: `bash bitcoin-setup.sh`
4. Download the Bitcoin client.
5. Disconnect from the Internet.
6. Generate a wallet by starting the Bitcoin client.
7. Export the wallet.
8. Use `splitsec.sh` to encrypt the wallet file and split the encryption key. If the script appears to hang, move the mouse around and open/close programs to produce more entropy.
9. Distribute the secret shares and encrypted wallet.
10. Send funds to the wallet's address.

## More Details

The wallet is encrypted with OpenSSL set to AES-256 in CBC mode. The encryption key is generated using `xkpa`, [my xkcd password generator](https://github.com/beala/xkcd-password). The secret is split using [ssss](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/).
