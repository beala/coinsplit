## Introduction

This is a set of utility scripts for backing up your Bitcoin wallet. They are designed to create an encrypted cold wallet whose encryption key is split with [secret sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing).

`bitcoin-setup.sh` installs all the prereqs for `splitsec.sh`.

`splitsec.sh` takes a Bitcoin wallet (or any file), encrypts it with an autogenerated key, and then splits the key into shares. These shares can later be used to reconstruct the key.

## Instructions

1. Load Ubuntu (tested on 12.10) onto a Live CD.
2. Boot the Live CD and connect to the Internet.
3. Add the `universe` repo to `/etc/apt/sources.list`.
4. Run the setup script: `bash bitcoin-setup.sh`
5. Download the Bitcoin client.
6. Disconnect from the Internet.
7. Generate a wallet by starting the Bitcoin client.
8. Export the wallet.
9. Use `splitsec.sh` to encrypt the wallet file and split the encryption key. If the script appears to hang, move the mouse around and open/close programs to produce more entropy.
10. **Make sure the encryption and secret splitting were successful, by recreating the secret from the shares and decrypting the wallet.**
11. Distribute the secret shares and encrypted wallet.
12. Send funds to the wallet's address.

## More Details

The wallet is encrypted with OpenSSL set to AES-256 in CBC mode. The encryption password is generated using `xkpa`, [my xkcd password generator](https://github.com/beala/xkcd-password). The secret is split using [ssss](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/).
